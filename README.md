<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;This open source project aims to provide blind and visually impaired users with an affordable solution for their indoor and outdoor day-to-day activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

And I created this preliminary prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbspThis is a pair of 3D printed eyeglasses with electronic components and an open source AI / ML / DL software.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I call it <b>VIsION AI Glasses for the Blind</b> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;><br><br></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sept 15 2019 Update:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly focused on hardware assembly and 3D printing for the past couple of months. Will update this repo with latest software code, hardware source files and circuitry schematics once hardware prototype design has been finalized for both plastic injection molding and 3D printing ...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;Through audible real time feedback, this can help me know the objects in front of me, their placement and the distance of my central focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;With these 3D printed glasses, I can also read text in physical objects like books and signboards, on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, this works with or without an Internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;My current version now provides audible real time GPS location data, as well as haptic feedback for distance sensing of up to 20 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="clear">A wearable form factor will free up both our hands and give us optimum mobility.</p>
<p style="clear"><ul><li>  This is unlike the difficulty we experience when we need to take out our smartphones from time to time while walking around and holding our white canes;</li><br>
<li>  This is also much better than straining our arms, necks and backs just to capture what's in front of us like a paper document or a set of physical objects; and</li><br>
<li>  I also want a solution that won't require me to take out my smartphone while walking around, especially here in the Philippines where I can be victimized by violent crooks who are out to steal expensive smartphones from random passersby (my blindness is due to a senseless incident of violence 15 years ago).</li></ul></p>

<p style="clear">For offline multiple object detection and recognition, I used the following:</p>
<p style="clear"><ul><li>  A set of fine-tuned object detection and recognition, person / face detection and age / gender estimation DL models; along with</li><br>
<li>  Custom scripts for distance estimation through an ultrasonic sensor and clockface object placement description through image post-processing.</li></ul></p>

<p style="clear">I also used services from Microsoft Cognitive Services (Computer Vision & Batch Read File APIs) and Cloudsight to integrate online object recognition, visual scene description and OCR (optical character recognition) functions.</p>
<p style="clear"><b>Note:</b>  Release v0.0.2 is updated with OCR functions ...</p>

<p style="clear">Audible descriptions are through the Pico library (text-to-speech with Android voice for Linux version) and Microsoft SAPI5 engine (full Windows 10 version). Meanwhile, remote manual visual assistance is through Skype (full Windows 10 version).</p>

<p style="clear">My device also serves as my pocket computer, which is very useful for me when I'm up and about.</p>

<p style="clear">I'm still working on offline OCR functions, mainly document detection and super-resolution among other image pre and post-processing functions. Plus:</p>
<p style="clear"><ul><li>  I'll continue to test and improve my trained / fine-tuned Tesseract model; and</li><br>
  <li>  I'll further optimize the hardware components and software features of my project.</li></ul></p>
