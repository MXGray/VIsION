# VIsION
This aims to provide visually impaired users with an affordable solution for their day-to-day activities.

Being completely blind myself, this can help me know the objects in front of me, their placement and the distance of my central focus, with or without an Internet connection.

I want a solution that won't require me to take out my smartphone, especially here in the Philippines where I can be victimized by violent crooks (my blindness is due to a senseless incident of violence 15 years ago).

I used services from Microsoft CIS and Cloudsight to integrate online object recognition and visual scene description functions.

For offline object detection and recognition, I used fine-tuned object detection and recognition, person / face detection and age / gender estimation AI models, along with scripts for distance estimation through an ultrasonic sensor and clockface object placement description through image post-processing.

Audible descriptions are through the Microsoft SAPI5 engine. Meanwhile, remote manual visual assistance is through Skype.

My device also serves as my pocket computer, which is very useful for me when I'm up and about.

I'm still working on online and offline OCR functions, mainly document detection and super-resolution among other image pre and post-processing functions. I'll test and use the Microsoft CIS Read API, ABBYY Cloud OCR and trained / fine-tuned Tesseract.

And, I'll further optimize the hardware components and software features of my project.
