<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol><li><b>CONCEPT VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Science & Technology of the Philippines gave us a 2-year R&D software development grant for our project. This was after we presented our proof of concept prototype to their panel of scientists, engineers and business professionals in 2017;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>TECH VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the earliest version of our prototype to the 2019 Microsoft HackerEarth Azure AI Hackathon. Our project was hand-picked for the finals round, out of more than 760+ professional dev't teams in New Zealand, South Korea and the rest of South East Asia. THis was after their panel of software engineers inspected our prototype; and</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>NICHE MARKET VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered our project to San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind's 2019 Holman Prize competition. Our project was inspected by a panel of esteemed blind and visually impaired judges. They hand-picked our project for the semi-finals round, out of over 100 entries from across 6 continents ...</li></ol></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sept 15 2019 Update:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly focused on hardware assembly and 3D printing for the past couple of months. Will update this repo with latest software code, hardware source files and circuitry schematics once hardware prototype design has been finalized for both plastic injection molding and 3D printing ...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
