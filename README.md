<p style="clear"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</h2></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li><b>SBC:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested on Intel Compute Stick (model with CORE M3 CPU), Liva Q, Raspberry Pi Zero WH, 3B+ and 4 model B</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>PLATFORM:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested on Microsoft Windows 10, Raspbian Stretch and Buster, Ubuntu 1809 & Android X86</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>PYTHON:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested on version 3.5 and 3.6</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>EXTERNAL HARDWARE:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested with USB 2.0 and 3.0 UVC 8Mp camera board with autoFocus Lens and built-in mic, Devantech SRF10 ultrasonic ranger, USB-ISS and GPIO-to-USB board, generic GPS module, bone-conduction speaker pads and stereo amplifier board, mini vibrating disk and DRV2605 microcontroller, USB soundcard, 4-port USB hub, generic programmable Bluetooth button and LiFePo4 batteries</li></ul></p>

<p style="clear"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;QUICK START</h2></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol><li>&nbsp;Install <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org" target="_blank">FFMPEG</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free" target="_blank">Screen-Capture-Recorder</a> (used for video and audio recording modes), <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-imagemagick-on-debian-ubuntu/" target="_blank">ImageMagick for Linux</a> or <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows 10</a> (used for OCR image post processing), Skype v8.53.0.85 for Microsoft Windows 10 (used for manual visual assistance mode, currently working on video calling for Linux), Mozilla Firefox v68.2.0 and a few other tools for Linux (follow comments in vision.py file);</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Open Firefox. Go to about:config, search and set media > navigator > disabled to True, and toolkit > startup > max_resumed_crashes to a fairly large integer. Afterwards, install the Auto Fullscreen extension;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Make sure the tools above are in the system path;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Clone this repository ( git clone https://github.com/MXGray/VIsION.git );</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Go to cloned repo ( cd /path-where-you-cloned-this-repo/VIsION );</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Run python -m pip install -r requirements.txt;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Inside your cloned repo's root directory, you'll see the freeware SeeingWithSound© vOICe offline Web app as a complete HTM directory with an HTML file. The vOICe Java applet / application is written by <A HREF="http://www.artificialvision.com/javoice.htm" target="_blank">Peter B.L. Meijer</A>. You can open Firefox and go <a href="https://www.seeingwithsound.com/webvoice/webvoice.htm" target="_blank">here</a> to install this freeware as an offline Web app. And when you want to use this freeware with this 3D printed eyeglasses, then don't forget to update the necessary directory and HTML filename in the vision.py file;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Download a pre-trained Caffe model <a href="http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/model/caffe/" target="_blank">here</a>, store it in multiobj/ade20k/ and rename the caffemodel and prototxt files ( should be dn.caffemodel and dn.prototxt );</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Download a pre-trained Mask-rCNN model <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/19/mask-r-cnn-with-opencv/" target="_blank">here</a> and store it inside multiobj, along with pre-trained Caffe models for face detection, age and gender estimation (folders inside multiobj are labeled);</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;OR, just use re-trained models (via transfer learning) bundled with this repo, except for Ade20K and Mask-rCNN ( download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICsBxdpFfAd-cQfEmlLTG5lUqwaWzSa8/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFNq5xhTzkJ3Tnaw-JO8kL_ZIoYL92-I/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, as they're too big for Github, put dn.caffemodel inside multiobj/ade20k and navnet.pb in multiobj ); and</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;Finally, run python vision.py&nbsp;...&nbsp;</li></ol></p>

<p style="clear"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW IT WORKS</h2></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol><li><b>3D SOUNDSCAPE:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeware SeeingWithSound© vOICe using bone conduction speaker pads) for "visual" interpretation of scenes and objects through trained neural auditory synthesis for those who became blind from the age of 7 and above;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>PRE-TRAINED ML & DL MODELS:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Local and server-hosted machine learning and deep learning models For describing visual scenes and objects with its clockface locations, for converting text in physical objects like books and signboards, for detecting persons and their current actions along with estimating their age and gender, and 10x much faster processing when online;</li>

<p style="clear"><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;VALIDATION PROCESS</h2></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol><li><b>CONCEPT VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Science & Technology of the Philippines gave us a 2-year R&D software development grant for our project. This was after we presented our proof of concept prototype to their panel of scientists, engineers and business professionals in 2017;</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>TECH VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the earliest version of our prototype to the 2019 Microsoft HackerEarth Azure AI Hackathon. Our project was hand-picked for the finals round, out of more than 760+ professional dev't teams in New Zealand, South Korea and the rest of South East Asia. This was after their panel of software engineers inspected our prototype; and</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><b>NICHE MARKET VALIDATION:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered our project to San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind's 2019 Holman Prize competition. Our project was inspected by a panel of esteemed blind and visually impaired judges. They hand-picked our project for the semi-finals round, out of over 100 entries from across 6 continents ...</li></ol></p>

<p style="clear">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sept 15 2019 Update:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly focused on hardware assembly and 3D printing for the past couple of months. Will update this repo with latest software code, hardware source files and circuitry schematics once hardware prototype design has been finalized for both plastic injection molding and 3D printing ...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
